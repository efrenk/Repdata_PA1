Peer Assessment 1
=================

Peer assessment 1 assignment for Coursera course [Reproducible Research](Reproducible Research).

> ## Introduction
> 
> It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal
> movement using activity monitoring devices such as a
> [Fitbit](http://www.fitbit.com), [Nike
> Fuelband](http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/nikeplus-fuelband), or
> [Jawbone Up](https://jawbone.com/up). These type of devices are part of
> the "quantified self" movement -- a group of enthusiasts who take
> measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to
> find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But
> these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to
> obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for
> processing and interpreting the data.
> 
> This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring
> device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the
> day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous
> individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012
> and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.
> 
> ## Data
> 
> The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web
> site:
> 
> * Dataset: [Activity monitoring data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) [52K]
> 
> The variables included in this dataset are:
> 
> * **steps**: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing
>     values are coded as `NA`)
> 
> * **date**: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD
>     format
> 
> * **interval**: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which
>     measurement was taken
> 
> 
> 
> 
> The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there
> are a total of 17,568 observations in this
> dataset.
> 
> 
> ## Assignment
> 
> This assignment will be described in multiple parts. You will need to
> write a report that answers the questions detailed below. Ultimately,
> you will need to complete the entire assignment in a **single R
> markdown** document that can be processed by **knitr** and be
> transformed into an HTML file.
> 
> Throughout your report make sure you always include the code that you
> used to generate the output you present. When writing code chunks in
> the R markdown document, always use `echo = TRUE` so that someone else
> will be able to read the code. **This assignment will be evaluated via
> peer assessment so it is essential that your peer evaluators be able
> to review the code for your analysis**.
> 
> For the plotting aspects of this assignment, feel free to use any
> plotting system in R (i.e., base, lattice, ggplot2)
> 
> Fork/clone the [GitHub repository created for this
> assignment](http://github.com/rdpeng/RepData_PeerAssessment1). You
> will submit this assignment by pushing your completed files into your
> forked repository on GitHub. The assignment submission will consist of
> the URL to your GitHub repository and the SHA-1 commit ID for your
> repository state.
> 
> NOTE: The GitHub repository also contains the dataset for the
> assignment so you do not have to download the data separately.
> 
> 
> Will use the dataset 'activity.zip' 

Load packages.


```r
packages <- c("data.table", "ggplot2", "xtable", "VIM")
sapply(packages, require, character.only=TRUE, quietly=TRUE)
```

```
## VIM is ready to use. 
##  Since version 4.0.0 the GUI is in its own package VIMGUI.
## 
##           Please use the package to use the new (and old) GUI.
## 
## 
## Attaching package: 'VIM'
## 
## The following object is masked from 'package:datasets':
## 
##     sleep
```

```
## data.table    ggplot2     xtable        VIM 
##       TRUE       TRUE       TRUE       TRUE
```


> ### Loading and preprocessing the data
> 
> Show any code that is needed to
> 
> 1. Load the data (i.e. `read.csv()`)
> 
> 2. Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis

Unzip the data file.


```r
f <- file.path(getwd(), "activity.zip")
if (file.exists(f)) {
   unzip(f, exdir="./")
}
```

Read the CSV file.
Convert the data frame to a data table using the [`data.table`](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html) package.


```r
dt <- read.csv(file.path(getwd(), "activity.csv"))
dt <- data.table(dt)
```
 
Verify that the number of rows in the dataset is the expected value of 17,568.


```r
check <- nrow(dt) == 17568
if (check == FALSE) stop("The number of rows in the dataset is not 17,568.")
```

Convert the `date` variable to a date class.
And look at the structure of the dataset.


```r
dt <- dt[, date := as.Date(date)]
setkey(dt, date, interval)
str(dt)
```

```
## Classes 'data.table' and 'data.frame':	17568 obs. of  3 variables:
##  $ steps   : int  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
##  $ date    : Date, format: "2012-10-01" "2012-10-01" ...
##  $ interval: int  0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 ...
##  - attr(*, ".internal.selfref")=<externalptr> 
##  - attr(*, "sorted")= chr  "date" "interval"
```

```r
dt
```

```
##        steps       date interval
##     1:    NA 2012-10-01        0
##     2:    NA 2012-10-01        5
##     3:    NA 2012-10-01       10
##     4:    NA 2012-10-01       15
##     5:    NA 2012-10-01       20
##    ---                          
## 17564:    NA 2012-11-30     2335
## 17565:    NA 2012-11-30     2340
## 17566:    NA 2012-11-30     2345
## 17567:    NA 2012-11-30     2350
## 17568:    NA 2012-11-30     2355
```


> ### What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
> 
> For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in
> the dataset.
> 
> 1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
> 
> 2. Calculate and report the **mean** and **median** total number of steps taken per day

Aggregate the number of steps taken each day.
Days with missing values (`NA`) will have `NA` when aggregated.


```r
dtDaily <- dt[, list(sumSteps = sum(steps)), date]
head(dtDaily)
```

```
##          date sumSteps
## 1: 2012-10-01       NA
## 2: 2012-10-02      126
## 3: 2012-10-03    11352
## 4: 2012-10-04    12116
## 5: 2012-10-05    13294
## 6: 2012-10-06    15420
```

Plot a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.


```r
ggplot(dtDaily, aes(x=sumSteps)) +
	geom_histogram(alpha=1/2, binwidth=1000)
```

![plot of chunk histogramStepsTakenEachDay](figure/histogramStepsTakenEachDay.png) 

Calculate the mean and median total number of steps taken per day **before imputing**.


```r
tab <- dtDaily[, list(n = .N, nValid = sum(!is.na(sumSteps)), mean = mean(sumSteps, na.rm=TRUE), median = median(sumSteps, na.rm=TRUE))]
print(xtable(tab), type="html", include.rownames=FALSE)
```

   </TABLE>

Copy the data table `dtDaily` before imputation to be used later.


```r
dtDaily <- dtDaily[, status := "Before imputation"]
dtDailyBeforeImputation <- dtDaily
```

Aggregate the average number of steps taken by 5-minute interval.


```r
dtIntervals <- dt[, list(meanSteps = mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE)), interval]
```

Plot a time series of the 5-minute interval and the average number of steps taken across all days.


```r
ggplot(dtIntervals, aes(x=interval, y=meanSteps)) +
	geom_line()
```

Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

Calculate the total number of missing values.


```r
dt <- dt[, isStepsMissing := is.na(steps)]
tab <- dt[, .N, isStepsMissing]
print(xtable(tab), type="html", include.rownames=FALSE)
```

<!-- html table generated in R 3.1.1 by xtable 1.7-3 package -->
<!-- Fri Aug 15 15:09:00 2014 -->
<TABLE border=1>
<TR> <TH> isStepsMissing </TH> <TH> N </TH>  </TR>
  <TR> <TD> TRUE </TD> <TD align="right"> 2304 </TD> </TR>
  <TR> <TD> FALSE </TD> <TD align="right"> 15264 </TD> </TR>
   </TABLE>

Used the [VIM](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/VIM/index.html) package to impute missing values of the `steps` variable.
Used k-Nearest Neighbour Imputation.


```r
dt <- kNN(dt)
```

```
## Time difference of -10.57 secs
```

The `kNN` function returns a dataset with all `NA`s replaced.
So the `steps` variable now contains imputed values replacing the `NA`s.

Verify that there are no missing values for `steps` after imputation.


```r
tab <- dt[, .N, list(isMissing = is.na(steps))]
print(xtable(tab), type="html", include.rownames=FALSE)
```

<!-- html table generated in R 3.1.1 by xtable 1.7-3 package -->

<TR> <TH> isMissing </TH> <TH> N </TH>  </TR>
  <TR> <TD> FALSE </TD> <TD align="right"> 17568 </TD> </TR>
   </TABLE>

Verify that missingness is complete for an entire day.
Show all days with at least 1 missing value for the `steps` variable.
Calculate the proportion of records with missing values for each such day.
All proportions are 100%.


```r
dtMissingness <- dt[, list(countMissing = sum(isStepsMissing), countRecords = .N, propMissing = sum(isStepsMissing / .N)), date]
dtMissingness[countMissing > 0]
```

```
##          date countMissing countRecords propMissing
## 1: 2012-10-01          288          288           1
## 2: 2012-10-08          288          288           1
## 3: 2012-11-01          288          288           1
## 4: 2012-11-04          288          288           1
## 5: 2012-11-09          288          288           1
## 6: 2012-11-10          288          288           1
## 7: 2012-11-14          288          288           1
## 8: 2012-11-30          288          288           1
```

#### After imputation of missing values

Aggregate the number of steps taken each day.


```r
dtDaily <- dt[, list(sumSteps = sum(steps), isImputed = sum(steps_imp) > 0), date]
head(dtDaily)
```

```
##          date sumSteps isImputed
## 1: 2012-10-01     3036      TRUE
## 2: 2012-10-02      126     FALSE
## 3: 2012-10-03    11352     FALSE
## 4: 2012-10-04    12116     FALSE
## 5: 2012-10-05    13294     FALSE
## 6: 2012-10-06    15420     FALSE
```

Plot a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day **after imputing** and compare with the histogram **before imputing**.
Need to add an `isImputed` column to `dtDailyBeforeImputation` to make `rbind` work.


```r
dtDaily <- dtDaily[, status := "After imputation"]
dtDailyBeforeImputation <- dtDailyBeforeImputation[, isImputed := FALSE]
dtDaily <- rbind(dtDaily, dtDailyBeforeImputation, use.names=TRUE)
ggplot(dtDaily, aes(x=sumSteps, fill=isImputed)) +
	geom_histogram(alpha=1/2, binwidth=1000) +
  facet_wrap(~ status, nrow=2) +
  theme(legend.position="bottom")
```

![plot of chunk histogramStepsTakenEachDayAfterImputation](figure/histogramStepsTakenEachDayAfterImputation.png) 

Calculate the mean and median total number of steps taken per day **after imputing**.


```r
tab <- dtDaily[, list(n = .N, nValid = sum(!is.na(sumSteps)), mean = mean(sumSteps, na.rm=TRUE), median = median(sumSteps, na.rm=TRUE)), status]
print(xtable(tab), type="html", include.rownames=FALSE)
```

<!-- html table generated in R 3.1.1 by xtable 1.7-3 package -->
<!-- Fri Aug 15 15:09:11 2014 -->
<TABLE border=1>

   </TABLE>

The median of the imputed values is the same as the original values where missing values were not imputed.
However, the mean of the imputed values is **less than** the original values.
The overall impact of the imputed values is to **lower** the estimates of the number of steps taken each day.

Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels -- "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
Use this solution to [collapse the factor values](http://stackoverflow.com/a/9053619) for day of week.
Verify that `dayOfWeek` and `dayType` are factor class variables.


```r
levels <- c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday")
newLevels <- c("Weekend", rep("Weekday", 5), "Weekend")
dt <- dt[, dayOfWeek := factor(weekdays(date), levels=levels)]
dt <- dt[, dayType := factor(newLevels[dayOfWeek])]
dt[, .N, list(dayType, dayOfWeek)]
```

```
##    dayType dayOfWeek    N
## 1: Weekday    Monday 2592
## 2: Weekday   Tuesday 2592
## 3: Weekday Wednesday 2592
## 4: Weekday  Thursday 2592
## 5: Weekday    Friday 2592
## 6: Weekend  Saturday 2304
## 7: Weekend    Sunday 2304
```

```r
message(sprintf("Is dayOfWeek a factor? %s. Is dayType a factor? %s", is.factor(dt$dayOfWeek), is.factor(dt$dayType)))
```

```
## Is dayOfWeek a factor? TRUE. Is dayType a factor? TRUE
```

Aggregate the average number of steps taken by 5-minute interval.
Use the imputed values in the `steps` variable.


```r
dtIntervals <- dt[, list(meanSteps = mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE)), list(dayType, interval)]
```

Plot two time series (one for weekdays and the other for weekends) of the 5-minute intervals and average number of steps taken (imputed values).


```r
ggplot(dtIntervals, aes(x=interval, y=meanSteps, color=dayType)) +
	geom_line() +
	facet_wrap(~ dayType, nrow=2) +
	theme(legend.position="none")
```

![plot of chunk timeseriesStepsTakenEachIntervalByDayTypePanel](figure/timeseriesStepsTakenEachIntervalByDayTypePanel.png) 

It's a bit hard to discern any differences.
So overlay the time series on a single plot instead of using a panel plot.


```r
ggplot(dtIntervals, aes(x=interval, y=meanSteps, color=dayType)) +
	geom_line() +
	theme(legend.position="bottom")
```
